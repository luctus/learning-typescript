# Learning TypeScript
A place where I put all my personal exercises for learning typescript

So it's time to start learning TypeScript :)

## Development

I installed the `npm` compiler package and the [typescript-vim](https://github.com/leafgarland/typescript-vim) syntax plugin for neovim.

To compile: `tsc car.ts`

The, open the `index.html` file in your browser.
